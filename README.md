# Website Finder
 
1) searches with keywords and scrapes search results (can be also restricted by a time period - example: only scrape websites from 2007 to 2009)
2) goes to each website and attempts to find contact email addresses and copyright dates in the footer
3) sends an email to each one of them and displays the results to the user

- The first step can be exchanged for loading a list of email addresses in the app - it would then extract the domains and perform the steps 2 and 3 as usual.
- Users have the option to export the results in the CSV format
